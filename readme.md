Mapping @dril tweets as answers to r/AskReddit questions. Created for Spring 2021 Programming Design course.

Tweets are matched by similarity to the question, and a polarity analisys is performed on the tweet to determine how dril 'feels' about the question. 

The design, inspired partially by Instagram account @affirmations, utilizes the Drawbot library to make Instagram posts.
